# 11th-and-pine
Capstone project documentation for 11th & Pine: a location-based audio app about CHOP.

## Project Overview
This is a capstone project that explores how the digital archive of CHOP can be experienced through audio storytelling combined with walking through the streets where the events took place. By listening to protest narratives while moving through these locations, users are invited to reconnect with the moments when the protests unfolded. The project focuses on the Capitol Hill Occupied Protests (CHOP) in Seattle and uses locative audio storytelling to link oral histories to specific physical sites, creating an embodied experience.

This project is sponsored by the University of Washington School of Drama.

## Project Goals
